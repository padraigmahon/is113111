                <p>Software as a service is  a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. 
                It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software", and was formerly referred to as "software plus services" by Microsoft.
                SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.<br>
                 SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications, including office software, messaging software, payroll processing software, DBMS software, management software, CAD software, development software, gamification, 
                 virtualization, accounting, collaboration, customer relationship management,
                 Management Information Systems, enterprise resource planning, invoicing, human resource management, talent acquisition, learning management systems, content management, and service desk management. 
                 SaaS has been incorporated into the strategy of nearly all leading enterprise software companies.</p>

                 <p>Salesforce is an American cloud computing company headquartered in San Francisco, California. Though its revenue comes from a customer relationship management product,
                 Salesforce also sells commercial applications of social networking through acquisition and internal development.
                 As of early 2018, it is one of the most highly valued American cloud computing companies with a market capitalization above $88 billion. In August 2017, Salesforce announced that
                 it had reached the $10 billion revenue run rate becoming the first enterprise cloud company to do so.</p>

                <h3>Platform as a Service - Cloud 9</h3><br><br>
                <p>Platform as a Service is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop,
                run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.
                PaaS can be delivered in three ways: as a public cloud service from a provider, where the consumer controls software deployment with minimal configuration options, 
                and the provider provides the networks, servers, storage, operating system, middleware (e.g. Java runtime, .NET runtime, integration, etc.), database and other services to host the consumer's application as a private service inside the firewall, 
                or as software deployed on a public infrastructure as a service.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Cloud 9 is an internet development environment (IDE) which was acquired by amazon in 2016.
                It supports hundreds of programming languages, including C, C++, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Python, JavaScript with Node.js, and Go. 
                It enables developers to get started with coding immediately with pre-configured workspaces, collaborate with their peers with collaborative coding features,
                and web development features like live preview and browser compatibility testing.</p>

                <h3>Infrastucture as a Service - Amazon Web Services</h3><br><br>
                <p>In an IaaS model, a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center, 
                including servers, storage and networking hardware, 
                as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.<br><br>
                The IaaS provider also supplies a range of services to accompany those infrastructure components. These can include detailed billing,
                monitoring, log access, security, load balancing and clustering, as well as storage resiliency, such as backup, replication and recovery.
                These services are increasingly policy-driven, enabling IaaS users to implement greater levels of automation and orchestration for important infrastructure tasks.
                For example, a user can implement policies to drive load balancing to maintain application availability and performance.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an example of IaaS, it is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow.

                cloud products and solutions to build sophisticated applications with increased flexibility, scalability and reliability.<br><br>
                AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software vendors that make it easy to find,
                test, buy, and deploy software that runs on AWS.</p>

                <h3>Communication as a Service - Gmail</h3><br><br>
                <!--- Contenet from http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Communications-as-a-Service-CaaS --->
                <p>Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. 
                Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), 
                instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices. 
                CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS).<br><br>
                CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and medium-sized business might not otherwise afford, 
                allowing for the addition of devices, modes or coverage on demand. 
                The network capacity and feature set can be changed from day to day if necessary so that functionality keeps pace with demand and resources are not wasted. 
                There is no risk of the system becoming obsolete and requiring periodic major upgrades or replacement.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Gmail is an example of CaaS. Gmail is a free, advertising-supported email service developed by Google.
                Users can access Gmail on the web and using third-party programs that synchronize email content through POP or IMAP protocols. 
                Gmail started as a limited beta release on April 1,
                2004, and ended its testing phase on July 7, 2009.<br><br>
                Google's mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including to filter spam and malware, 
                and to add context-sensitive advertisements next to emails. This advertising practice has been significantly criticized by privacy advocates due to concerns over unlimited data retention,
                ease of monitoring by third parties, users of other email providers not having agreed to the policy upon sending emails to Gmail addresses, and the potential for Google to change its policies to further decrease privacy by combining information with other Google data usage
                The company has been the subject of lawsuits concerning the issues. Google has stated that email users must "necessarily expect" their emails to be subject to automated processing, and claims that the service refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages,
                such as those mentioning race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial statements. In June 2017, Google announced the upcoming end to the use of contextual Gmail content for advertising purposes,
                relying instead on data gathered from use of its other services.</p>
